# committers-of-github

We all love making silly commit messages. For example: "egg". Or "minor changes".

Feel free to put any commit message on here. Open a new branch to set up a new "thread" for commit messages.

If you'd like to join in the fun, contact someone who has access and hopefully the message will propagate to danlliu.

Please stay civil :)
